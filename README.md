# Power_BI_Dashboard

The Zomato dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of Zomato's performance metrics and service data.
With significant sales in cities like Tirupati and Bangalore, focusing on similar high-demand urban areas could enhance market penetration.
Understanding regional preferences, like the high demand for vegetarian items, can tailor marketing and partnership strategies.

This dashboard provides insightful visualizations of key sales performance indicators (KPIs) to help analyze trends, identify top sales and gain a deeper understanding of the Zomato. By leveraging the power of Power BI, I was able to create a user-friendly interface that allows for easy exploration and data manipulation. This project has been a fantastic learning experience in data analysis and visualization.
